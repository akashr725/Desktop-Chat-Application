# Desktop-Chat-Application
Here I am develop deskttop chat application using java socket programming. This is actually basic idea of chat appllication.
I create two file one is server side and another is clint side. You can do chat with server and clint simultaniuosly.
Lots of java package are used to implement this project. e.g. io,utill,swing etc. I also make user interface for chatting.
If anybody wants to implement it more better you can.
